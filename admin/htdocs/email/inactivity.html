			Dear [customer],
			<p></p>
			We Vikings have been sitting in our ship waiting for a call from you and our phone has simply not rang. We noticed that you haven't shipped anything with us since [last_shipment]. We are concerned and would like to know if there is anything that we might be able to do to continue moving your freight? If you simply haven't had any shipments since the last shipment, we must just be insecure and we ask your forgiveness. We sit in our ships, rowing all day long waiting for shipments. When a customer stops shipping, we get worried about what might have gone wrong. We also worry about how we are going to pay for our various Viking supplies without your shipments to sustain us.
			<p></p>
			Our goal is to save you time and money on shipping.  We can't live without you. We hunger for shipments. We are ok with begging for your shipments.
			<p></p>
			Please call us to quote and schedule your next shipment.
